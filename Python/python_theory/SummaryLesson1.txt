Summary of Lesson 1:

1) First, we learnt about the printing function: 

    print()

The printing function can be used to communicate something from the program state or content to you, the programmer, or, the user.

You can use the printing function to print a message as follows:

print("Hello, my name is Lisa")

What we are passing to the printing function, is a sentence deliminated using quotes. This is important, because anything which is not deliminated by quotes and is not a number, will be interpreted by python as a Variable or an Object.


2) Second, we learnt about different types in python:

    integers (any number without decimals)
    floats (decimal numbers)
    strings (words or sentences such as "hello")
    character (single letter or sign 'c')
    boolean (1 or 0, which is equivalent to True or False)
    
    
A neat way to find out the type of something in python is to use the function type()

    type(3) (This will return the type integer)


3) For loops and while loops
    
4) We started introducing the concept of a function. You already know two functions (print() and type()). Functions are one of the    core concepts of any programming language.
